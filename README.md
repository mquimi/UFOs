# UFOs

### Overview

This project was created to provide more information regarding UFO sightings. The analysis allowed users to filter sights by different criterias such as location, date and time, shape, and comments people said.

### Results:

In order to perform a search you must go to the "Filter Search" where the user will need to type in the date they are looking for.

Once the date is inputted, the change is dected and the table automatically updates.

You then start to fill the other filters: city, state, county and shape. Once each section is filled. the table gets updated with the correct data. 

There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)
### Summary:

Drawbacks: 
    - A drawback about this webpage are the filters. When a user is searching for a shape or city, they would have to go through the list, instead of having a dropdown of the options.

Recommendations:
    - One recommendation that the website can benefit from is having a drop down. This will make users life easier when filtering for a specifc date or location. 

    - Second recommendation is add a button that clears all results. I would not want to run a filter on top of information that is alredy there. There is a sense of rielf when we clear data that we do not need.
